# Frontend project 

**This project is being developed for the practice of frontend development and study new tools and technologies**

## Starting project


``npm install --force`` - installing dependencies. It's temporarily recommended to install with the `--force` flag. This is
necessary because some dependencies are not compatible with each other.  
  
``npm run dev`` or ``npm run dev:vite`` - first command is running the project in dev mode with **webpack**,
second command is running the project in dev mode with **vite**. If you want to change the code while application is running,
then use **vite** to rebuild the application faster.
